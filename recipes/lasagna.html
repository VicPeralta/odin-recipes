    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large spaghetti squash, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>pound bulk pork sausage</li>
        <li>tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>tablespoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>teaspoons salt, divided</li>
        <li>(28 ounce) can Italian crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>tablespoons Marsala wine</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>sprigs fresh basil, leaves stripped from stems</li>
        <li>teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>(16 ounce) package sliced fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place each squash half cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a knife, about 45 minutes. Remove from oven and cool
            until easily handled. Scrape insides of squash into spaghetti strands with a fork. Transfer to a colander
            and place over a bowl to drain.</li>
        <li>While squash is baking, heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and garlic. Cook and stir
            until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add sausage, breaking it up with a
            sturdy spoon to remove clumps. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir Worcestershire sauce, Italian seasoning, and 1 teaspoon salt into the sausage mixture. Add crushed
            tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add wine and cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, basil leaves, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Layer 1/2 of the shredded spaghetti squash, 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, and 1/2 of the meat mixture in a
            4-quart glass baking dish. Repeat layers once more, and top with mozzarella cheese slices.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway through, until cheese is golden, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and immediately top with thin basil slices. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before
            slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
